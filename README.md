# Quizzical App

Idea for a Quizzical app was taken from [Learn React for free by Bob Ziroll](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact/react-section-4-solo-project-co24f49bea8aace7c174082c8).

Quiz is fetched from [Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php).

Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
